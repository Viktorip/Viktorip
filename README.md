I'm a Full Stack Developer and I've previously worked with React, jquery and perl as my job. My most recent experience is on React and NextJS. On my free time I keep up with my web development skills by learning new things like NextJS. Even further back in my history I've worked as a game developer and I've published one game made by myself on the google play store. Even before that in the ancient times I made several games in Adobe Flash that can still be found in the corners of internet that still run Flash game portals. Coding has been a part of me all my adult life whether it be making games or web apps.
